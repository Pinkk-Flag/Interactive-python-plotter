# What is this?
Hi! This is just a simple project I made in about 2 hours. It is just putting my matplotlib understanding into a more practical and userfriendly way. It's quite useful, having features such as axis titles, option of scatter vs line, titles, etc. Of course, it's not as sophisticated as other programs like Desmos, but it hopes to add a little more of a "keyboardy" feel to graphing. I've mainly made this to make plotting easier and better in other projects like school, personal learning, etc. 

# How to use?
Simply download as a zip (or git clone) and then go to **dist --> plotter.exe**. Double click on the exe file and then enjoy! The code is simply in plotter.py, with t1.py just being a test. You can ignore t1.py. 

# Stable release v1
This version isn't the best. It can handle only 2 types of plots (line and scatter). The functionality is not great, but it is functional. Future releases will generally depend on how much time I have.
